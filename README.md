# DesignPatternsInCpp
This repository contains simple use case examples of design patterns.
The examples show are simplistic on purpose. This allows to focus on
the pattern concepts without being distracted by details having 
nothing to do with those concepts.

Creational patterns:
	* Composite:
	Composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern and describes a group of 
	objects that is treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of 
	object. The intent of a composite is to “compose” objects into tree structures
	to represent part-whole hierarchies.
	* Factory:
	The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple
	sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This 
	pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the
	client program to the factory class.
	* Abstract factory:
	The abstract factory pattern in software engineering is a design that provides
	a way to create families of related objects without imposing their concrete 
	classes, by encapsulating a group of individual factories that have a common
	theme without specifying their concrete classes.

Behavioral patterns:
