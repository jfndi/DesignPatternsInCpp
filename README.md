# DesignPatternsInCpp
This repository contains simple use case examples of design patterns.
The examples show are simplistic on purpose. This allows to focus on
the pattern concepts without being distracted by details having 
nothing to do with those concepts.

Creational patterns:
	* Composite
	Composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern and describes a group of 
	objects that is treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of 
	object. The intent of a composite is to “compose” objects into tree structures
	to represent part-whole hierarchies.
	* Factory
	The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple
	sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This 
	pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the
	client program to the factory class.
